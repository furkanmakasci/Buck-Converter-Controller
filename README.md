# Buck-Converter-Controller
Analog Buck Converter Controller with Current Limiting Feature

200 kHz buck controller circuit, used OPAx197s. 7805 used for refence voltage(to supply opamps). Also, frequency of triangle wave generater first was calculated for 12V, so you can use 12V regulator and gain for reading current. Frequency 209 kHz --> 12V, 230 kHz --> 5V.
...

Drive part is up to you...

I want to implement a part for synchronous buck later..
